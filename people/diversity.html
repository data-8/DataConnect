<blockquote>Data Science Scholars seeks to prevent the same issues of diversity that plague other departments.
    We believe that Data Science as a field benefits from having a heterogeneous student body. 
    We believe that demographics of the student body affect what data is being collected, 
    what questions are being asked and which questions are being answered. 
    Data Scholars hopes to attract underrepresented and nontraditional students who through a little bit of help can 
    realize their potential as a men/femtor to the Data Science community and their fellow peers. </blockquote>
