										<h2 class="major">About the Team</h2>
										<p>The projects team was founded the fall 2016 semester with the goal of expanding the data science research opportunities and making them more accessible to the undergraduate population. The data science program reaches across all fields and disciplines, and it is our goal to ensure that the data science project ecosystem represents all of these interests. </p>

										<p>Hi, I’m Rebecca Lysaght! I’m a third year Cognitive Science Major and Computer Science minor.  In my spare time I like to play basketball and water polo, watch movies, and frequent the coffee shops of Berkeley.  I’m excited to be working with the projects team and hope to get more students involved in Data Science here at Cal!</p>

											<h3 class="major">DataHive</h3>
											<p>Datahive is the research application system that BIDs will be using to host all of our exciting research opportunities. Datahive aims to be a central application portal that allows students to easily find and apply to data science projects across all disciplines. With Datahive, we’re looking to change the way students apply for projects at UC Berkeley.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Project Consulting Program</h3>
											<p>We hold all of our research projects within BIDs to a very high level. We want to ensure the best possible research experience, and because of this goal we make sure that all of our projects are student focused. In order to make sure that all projects meet our expectations and can weather any snags that they may face throughout the semester, we have assembled a team of project consultants. Their role is to come in and support any research team to get them back on track so that they can focus on their research, not the time consuming management that comes along with it.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Project Management Guide</h3>
											<p>Management is an art. There are so many kinks to it, but yet there’s no real place to turn to in school to help people become great project leads. Being around so many talented project managers within the Berkeley Institute of Data Science, we have been able to draw a lot from them. This guide is the cumulation of the experiences of project leaders here at Berkeley, and with this we hope to inspire undergraduates to take part of this research initiative and lead their own projects!</p>
